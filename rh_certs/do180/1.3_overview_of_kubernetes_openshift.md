# Overview of Kubernetes and OpenShift

## Limitations of Containers
Containers provide an easy way to package and run services but as the number of containers that need to be managed grow, managing them manually isn't feasible.

Enterprises that use containers often require the following:
- Easy communication between a large number of services
- Resource limits on applications regardless of the number of containers running them
- Responses to application usage spikes to increase or decrease the number of running containers
- Reaction to service deterioration
- Gradual roll-out of new releases to a set of users

Enterprises often require a container orchestration technology because container runtimes(such as Podman) do not adequately address the above requirements

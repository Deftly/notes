# Getting Started
This section will go over some background on version control tools and how to get Git running on your system.

## About Version Control
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific version later. Most often done with software source code though this can be done with nearly any type of file on a computer.

### Local Version Control Systems
Local VCSs initially had a simple database that kept all the changes to files under revision control.

# Git Basics
This section will every basic command you need to do the vast majority of tasks with Git. This includes configuring and initializing a repository, begin and stop tracking files, and stage and commit changes. We'll also go over how to set up Git to ignore certain files and file patterns, how to undo mistakes quickly and easily, how to browse the history of your project and view changes between commits, and how to push and pull from remote repositories. 

## Getting A Git Repository
This is typically done in one of two ways:
- You can take a local directory that is not currently under version control and turn it into a Git repository.
- You can *clone* an existing Git repository from somewhere else.
